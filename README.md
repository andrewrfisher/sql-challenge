SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts


The "EmployeeSQL" folder contains all of the CSVs.

The main portion of the homework is in the file named "final_sql_hw.sql". Both the tables and the queries are in that file.

The Bonus is in the Jupyter Notebooks file. 

The "Images" Folder contains the ERD and the bar graph from the challenge. I could not quite figure out the histogram in time.
